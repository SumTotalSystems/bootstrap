  <p class="lead">AngularStrap is a set of native directives that enables seamless integration of Bootstrap#^3.0 into your AngularJS#^1.2 application.</p>
  <p>With no external dependency except the Bootstrap CSS styles, AngularStrap is light and fast. It has been built from the ground up to leverage ngAnimate!</p>

  <h2>Quick Start</h2>
  <p>Inject the <code>mgcrea.ngStrap</code> module into your app (don't forget <code>ngAnimate</code>):</p>
  {% highlight js %}
  angular.module('myApp', ['ngAnimate', 'mgcrea.ngStrap']);
  {% endhighlight %}

  <p>
    Angular Strap has a bunch of controls. Some of them we've modified to fit SumTotal's style. To see a full list of examples follow the link below.
