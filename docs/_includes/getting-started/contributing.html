  <p>SumTotal Foundation Bootstrap was never intended to be developed in a closed fashion. The idea is that Foundation becomes a toolbox for all SumTotal developers to use while building our products. There are such a vast amount of use cases for each of our product pillars that we simply cannot anticiapte every control or style required. To overcome this <strong>we want all developers at SumTotal</strong> to contribute to this project.</p>
  <p>We imagine that a scenario for contributing code goes something like this: You're developing a new page and notice that there is a similar control (or styling) that UX has defined. You then create a reusable control (or style) that can be applied in the many places you would normally have to provide markup. At this point you pull the latest Foundation code, merge your source into the codebase, provide unit tests, and submit a pull request.</p>
  <p>At this point the internal Foundation group will receive the request to pull in your new control (or style). We'll review the code for quality and confirm with UX that it should be reusable across all product pillars. Once it pases this threshold the code will be merged into Foundation and can be used by all developers.</p>

  <h2 id="contributing-installation">Development Environment<small>Installation Instructions</small></h2>

  <p>As previously mentioned Foundation Bootstrap uses NodeJS to build and maintain structure of the code. You'll need to install several prerequisites before you can start working with the source code. To begin install the following:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.nodejs.com" target="_blank">NodeJS</a></li>
    <li>Git <a href="https://msysgit.github.io/" target="_blank">(for Windows)</a></li>
  </ul>

  <ol>
    <li>Clone the repository: <code>git clone http://team2:8080/tfs/DefaultCollection/Foundation/_git/foundation-controls</code> using either <a href="https://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/" target="_blank">TortoiseGit</a> or from a command prompt.</li>
    <li>Open up a NodeJS command prompt as an Administrator</li>
    <li>Install global node module dependencies: <code>npm install -g gulp bower grunt-cli mocha jshint karma-cli</code>
    </li>
    <li>Go into the foundation-controls directory and install all NodeJS dependencies: <code>npm install</code>
    </li>
    <li>Install the bower components: <code>bower install</code>
    </li>
    <li>Ready to run!
      <ul>
        <li>Build a distributable package: <code>gulp</code> <em>(outputs to dist/ folder)</em>
        </li>
        <li>JavaScript code analysis: <code>gulp jshint</code>
        </li>
        <li>Serve example pages: <code>gulp serve</code>
        </li>
        <li>Run unit tests: <code>gulp test</code> or <code>gulp karma</code>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
