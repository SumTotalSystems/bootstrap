  <p class="lead">Foundation Bootstrap consists of four easy-to-consume files.</p>

  <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning" id="jquery-required">
    <h4>Everything that's required</h4>
    <p>Please note that <strong>everything</strong> which is required by Foundation is included in the following files. Including other scripts or style documents may cause conflicts. This site serves as a defacto standard for how all controls should appear. Please insure that if any other scripts or styles are included that they do not interfere with the Foundation base.</p>
  </div>

  <h2 id="whats-included-precompiled">Precompiled Bootstrap</h2>
  <p>Once installed through the NodeJS module you should have something similar to the following:</p>
<!-- NOTE: This info is intentionally duplicated in the README.
Copy any changes made here over to the README too. -->
{% highlight bash %}
foundation-bootstrap/
├── styles/
│   ├── foundation.css
│   └── vendor.css
└── scripts/
    ├── foundation.js
    └── vendor.js
{% endhighlight %}
<!-- NOTE: This info is intentionally duplicated in the README.
Copy any changes made here over to the README too. -->
  <p>This is the most basic and suggested form of Foundation: it is designed to be used in nearly any web project. Our fonts are currently imported via an include from a CDN.</p>

  <h2 id="whats-included-source">Foundation Bootstrap source code</h2>
  <p>The Foundation Bootstrap source code repository includes source Less, JavaScript, and example pages. More specifically, it includes the following and more:</p>
{% highlight bash %}
bootstrap/
├── examples/
├── gulp/
├── js/
│   └── vendor/
├── less/
│   ├── angular-strap/
│   ├── bootstrap/
│   └── sumtotal/
├── modules/
├── templates/
└── tests/
{% endhighlight %}
  <p>The <code>less/</code> and <code>modules/</code> are the source code for our CSS and JS (AngularJS controls), respectively. The <code>examples/</code> folder contains developer examples of Foundation usage. Beyond that, any other included file provides support for packages, license information, and development.</p>
